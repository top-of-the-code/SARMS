## Overview

SARMS is a university ERP that simulates real institutional workflows — automated semester promotion, graduation detection, credit-capped registration, and configurable academic terms — all secured behind stateless JWT authentication and role-isolated portals for Admins, Faculty, and Students.

Built by a four-person team following the **Waterfall Model**, with formal SRS documentation, DFD models, and UML class and sequence diagrams produced before a single line of code was written.

---

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Three Role-Based Portals** | Isolated dashboards for Admin, Faculty, and Student — each with discrete permissions and UI. |
| **Stateless JWT Authentication** | HMAC-SHA256 signed tokens with role-based endpoint guarding via Spring Security. |
| **One-Click Result Engine** | Bulk grade finalization, SGPA/CGPA recomputation, and semester promotion in a single atomic operation. |
| **Auto-Enrollment Pipeline** | Students automatically enrolled in next-semester core courses upon result publication. |
| **Graduation Detection** | Students completing semester 8 are automatically marked as graduated and deactivated. |
| **Double Authentication** | Destructive admin operations require real-time credential re-verification server-side — not a dialog box. |
| **Configurable Academic Clock** | Admin-controlled Monsoon/Spring term system governing course visibility and registration windows. |
| **Credit-Capped Registration** | Hard 25-credit ceiling with live tracking of core vs. elective allocation. |
| **Flexible Grading Engine** | Weighted components, "Best N of M" quiz policies, and automatic percentage-to-grade mapping. |
| **Self-Service Password Reset** | Two-step forgot-password flow with ID verification and BCrypt re-hashing. |

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              React SPA  (Vite + React Router)           │
│     Admin Portal  ·  Faculty Portal  ·  Student Portal  │
└──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                           │  REST  (Axios + JWT Bearer)
┌──────────────────────────▼──────────────────────────────┐
│                  Spring Boot Backend                    │
│                                                         │
│   JwtAuthFilter → Controller → Service → Repository     │
│                                    │                    │
│                         Spring Security Context         │
└──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                           │  Spring Data MongoDB
┌──────────────────────────▼──────────────────────────────┐
│                     MongoDB Atlas                       │
│   users · courses · enrollments · marks · semesters     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Every request passes through a custom `JwtAuthFilter` that validates the token and injects the user's identity and role into the Spring Security context. The backend follows strict **Controller → Service → Repository** layering, with repositories mapping directly to MongoDB Atlas collections.

## Engineering Decisions

**Double Authentication for Critical Operations**
Publishing results and wiping student data require the admin to re-enter credentials at the point of action, verified server-side against the BCrypt hash — not just a frontend confirmation dialog.

**Automated Semester Lifecycle Engine**
A single "Upload Results" action atomically finalizes grades for all enrolled students → recomputes SGPA → promotes to next semester → auto-enrolls in department-specific core courses → shifts the global academic term. One transactional flow.

**Automatic Graduation Detection**
Students completing semester 8 are programmatically marked inactive. Accounts remain accessible for transcript viewing but are locked out of registration and course workflows.

**Configurable Monsoon / Spring Academic Clock**
The admin shifts the university's active term between Monsoon (odd semesters) and Spring (even semesters). Controls course catalog visibility, student batch eligibility, and enforces semester-type parity rules.

**Credit-Capped Registration with Core Locking**
Core departmental courses are pre-enrolled and locked. Students modify only elective selections within a hard 25-credit ceiling, with real-time visual feedback on remaining capacity.

**"Best N of M" Grading Policy**
Faculty define policies like "Best 3 of 5 quizzes" — the engine automatically selects top scores and scales them during grade computation.

**Idempotent Database Seeding**
`DataSeeder` checks for existing data before inserting, making it safe to restart the server any number of times without duplication. It also force-syncs all user passwords on every boot to ensure cross-JDK BCrypt compatibility.

**Full System Reset with Selective Preservation**
The admin "Wipe" action (requiring typed confirmation) deletes all student accounts, enrollments, and marks while preserving the course catalog, faculty records, and grading configurations — designed for clean end-of-year resets.

**Stateless Architecture**
No session cookies. No server-side session stores. The entire auth layer is stateless — horizontal scaling requires zero session affinity.

## Software Engineering Artifacts

Produced during the formal SDLC phases before implementation began:

| Document | Description |
|---|---|
| [**SRS Document**](docs/SRS%20Documentation.pdf) | Complete functional and non-functional requirements specification. |
| [**DFD Model & Data Dictionary**](docs/DFD%20Model%20and%20Data%20Dictionary%20Documentation.pdf) | Level 0 & Level 1 data flow diagrams with formal definitions of all data elements and constraints. |
| [**Use Case Document**](docs/Use%20Case%20Documentation.pdf) | Actor-driven use case specifications for all system interactions. |
| [**Class Diagram**](docs/Class%20Diagram%20Documentation.pdf) | UML class diagram mapping entities, relationships, and service boundaries. |
| [**Sequence Diagram**](docs/Sequence%20Diagram%20Documentation.pdf) | Interaction diagrams for critical flows including authentication and result publishing. |

## Development Lifecycle

This project followed the **Waterfall Model** through a complete SDLC:

```
Requirement Analysis  →  System Design  →  Implementation  →  Testing
        │                     │                  │                │
   SRS · Stakeholder      DFD · UML           React +        Selenium
     interviews            artifacts         Spring Boot    WebDriver +
                                                            Playwright
```

The sequential approach locked design decisions before code was written, resulting in a stable, well-documented system with traceable requirements from SRS through to test coverage.
